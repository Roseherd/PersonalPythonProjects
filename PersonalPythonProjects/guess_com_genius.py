Level is the upper limit of the range of numbers that the player will be guessing from.
Level must be 1,000,000 and above.
If you're wondering why level is so high, it's because this game is for geniuses.
If you think you can play then go ahead, but if not play an easier version lol.
The player has an infinite number of tries in this guessing game.
Enjoy the guessing game :).
